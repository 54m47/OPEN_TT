# OPEN_TT

Open-source table tennis rubber development.

## Why

Top players use rubbers that aren't available to the public.
A "Hurricane 3" on the shelf and a Hurricane 3 in Ma Long's
hand are not the same rubber. Different sponge, hand-selected
topsheet, factory tuning. Everyone in the sport knows this.
Nobody does anything about it.

This project is an attempt to do something about it.

## What

Rubber formulations, sponge formulations, manufacturing
processes, and automated testing rig designs. All public.
If something works, you can make it yourself.

## Status

Early stage. Funding the workshop first. Check back.

## About

Made by a C programmer and robotics engineer who plays
table tennis every day and got tired of the equipment
double standard.
